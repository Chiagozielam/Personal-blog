What you see when you look at a webpage is a beautiful page with text, attractive colors, pictures, etc... But it is most likely that what you browser is receiving is basically html and CSS, which is then interpreted yo the form you see it. Most of the webpages available currently also includes numerous things like, videos, audio, animations, etc., currently almost all the website use at least a little bit of JavaScript, this is a more advanced topic and I would say some things about it in the future and also recommend places to learn it.(sips a cup of coffeeâ˜º).

Just forget I said that for now..ðŸ˜Š),e-commerce softwares, etc., often make use of more technologies (technologies here would mean languages, frameworks,etc), but these technologies are actually used to produce HTML and CSS for the browser to understand, and these larger sites like Facebook Instagram, twitter may use a database to store data, and programming languages such aw php, ASP.net python, etc, but you might not need to know these technologies for now to improve what the user sees.

Suubsequently we are going to look at HTML, and some interesting facts about it,.
