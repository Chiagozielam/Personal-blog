What you see when you look at a webpage is a beautiful page with text, attractive colors, pictures, etc... But it is most likely that what your browser is receiving is something that looks gibbrish (by this I mean, awkward code, nothing fancy. Mostly HTML, CSS and JavaScript), which is then interpreted to the form you see it. Most of the webpages available currently also includes numerous things like, videos, audio, animations, etc., Almost all websites available online use at least a little bit of JavaScript, this is a more advanced topic and I would say some things about it in the future and also recommend places to learn it.(sips a cup of coffeeâ˜º).

### `So Let's Look At Some Steps Taken In Creating A Website And How To Go Ibout It`
.

## Coding

Now, this is the bull here. When creating a website We basically make use of two technologies
- HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
- CSS (Cascading StyleSheet)  
  
With HTML and CSS knowledge, you're set to build your first webpage. HTML gives structure to your webpage checkout my article on [WHY HTML? WHAT IS HTML](https://spillili.netlify.com/why-html-what-is-html/)  
**CSS** is used to style the html code to make it look beautiful. Think of this like, HTML being the skeleton, while CSS owuld be the covering and the beautiful clothes you wear and your jeweries that makes you look cool.
  
A website built with HTML an CSS looks cool but mostly boring. Most Websites today make use of a popular programming languages called
- JavaScript  
  
##### **JavaScript** is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages â€” every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at â€” displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. â€” you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies.
*[Mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)*
  
  
  
  
  With JavaScript, the possibilities in a webpage scales to **1100%**. While many things normally default to using javascript to handle have been fixed by CSS3 and HTML5, some webpage functionalities that could be performed and most time performed better  with javascript would include:
  - Targetted Animations
  - Dynamic contents
  - Blazing fast website creations
  - SPA (Single Page Applications)  
    
JavaScript could also be used as a backend Porgramming languages using **NodeJS** ( *A JavaScript runtime envirunment built on the chrome v8 engine used to run JavaScript on the backend* ), other backend programming languages would include: *PYTHON, C#, PHP, RUBY, KOTLIN etc*.
  
  **Apart** from coding from scratch, there are some online tools ( Website builders) used in website creations where you just drag and drop, and voila! you have a fully set up webpage. These tools are amazing, especially for non developers and developers who wish to do a quick work and make quick money. These online tools work with a CMS ( Content management system ) that has different themes, drag and drop functionality, and different tools to select from. Of course there are still some differences here and there between this and having a software developer do it for you, but If you wish to set up a quick beautiful site? then go for it!
  some examples of these tool would include:
  - [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) ( Which is by far the most popular)
  - [Wix](https://wix.com)
  - [SquareSpace](https://squarespace.com)
  - [Web.com](https://web.com)
  - [Weebly](https://weebly.com)
  - [VOOG](https://voog.com)

## Getting A Domain And Hosting
  
Now, this is the next stage in website creations (Although, sometime this comes first before the actual development). In this stage you want to buy a **Domain** name and get hostiing to host your content and serve the content via the domain name you own.  
  
*some popular places to purchase a domain name would include:*
- [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com)
- [BlueHost](https://bluehost.com)
- [HostGator](https://hostgator.com)
- [Hostinger](https://hostinger.com)
- [Host9ja](https://host9ja.net)

  
**Apart** from this, there are free tools out there to deploy your webpages and get hosting with domain names. Though you have to pay the price of having their domain name attached to your own name. Developers starting out and wish to put their contents online are mostly adviced to make use of these free tools and have their contents online.
  
  *some of these free tools would include:*
- [Github](https://github.com) (The github platform is by far the best place to put out your static webpages easily and fast, they offer hosting and domain, While also promoting learning and collaboration among developers. Every new developer should sign up to the github platform and get better at these things, all for FREE! )
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com) ( With Netlify, you can access connect with your hosting which could be on github or other git platforms and serve your websites online for free on a free domain name provided by Netlify )
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com) ( The Heroku platform works like Netlify and is still one of the bes out there to use. It is both simple to use and fast. )
  
*Others may include:*
- [000WebHost](https://0000webhost.com)
- [Freehostia](https://freehostia.com)
- [AwardSpace](https://www.awardspace.com)
- [x10hosting](https://x10hosting.com/)
  
  
By creating your **content** ( Via coding or using an online web creation tool), Getting a **Domain Name**, and Getting **Hosting**, you are set with a web site fully online and can now share your stuff with the rest of the world ( in other words, " You'll Be like me!!", feel me? ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž).
