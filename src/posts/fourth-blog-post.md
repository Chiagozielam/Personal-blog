###HTML means -- Hyper Text Markup Language
.
`It is a markup language because it is basically used to give structure to a webpage,`
.
.
I'll give you few ways to think of HTML like..
.
* Think about the stories you read from the newspaper, for each story, there will be a headline, some text, and possibly some images. If the article is a long piece, there maybe subheadings that divide up the stories into parts that focuses on different aspects of probably the same thing. This structure help the reader to understand the stories in the newspaper.
.
.. Now think of an entirely different type of document --an insurance form. Insurance forms often headings for different sections, each section might then contain other different things normally contained in an invoice.
.
. 
* This is what HTML does, it is responsible for giving the structure to the website, the text, the images, etc. They are added to the site with html. It can also be compared to a skeleton, it gives the structure to the webpages(I feel so proud of myself right nowðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜Š.. Umm.. forget I said that). So we would have tags for adding tittles, text, images, video, links, lines, tables, etc.(this is cool rightðŸ˜Ž?).
